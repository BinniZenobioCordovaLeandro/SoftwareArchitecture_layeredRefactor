## Key Improvements

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Clear separation between domain logic and infrastructure
   - Independent domain entities that encapsulate business rules

2. **Dependency Inversion**
   - Domain defines interfaces that infrastructure implements
   - Application core doesn't depend on external frameworks

3. **Testability**
   - Components are isolated and can be tested independently
   - In-memory repositories facilitate testing without a database

4. **Maintainability**
   - Changes to one layer don't affect others
   - New features can be added without modifying existing code

5. **Extensibility**
   - New repository implementations can be added without changing business logic
   - User interface can be changed without affecting the domain model

## Code Structure Changes

| Original Structure | Refactored Structure | Purpose |
|-------------------|----------------------|---------|
| Mixed models | `domain/entities/` | Encapsulate domain concepts |
| Direct DB calls | `domain/repositories/` (interfaces) | Define repository contracts |
| | `infrastructure/repositories/` (implementations) | Implement data access |
| Mixed business logic | `application/services/` | Implement use cases |
| Exposed implementation details | `presentation/controllers/` | Handle user interaction |

## Conclusion
The refactored code structure follows the principles of Clean Architecture, which emphasizes separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability. The new structure allows for easier scaling and modification of the system without affecting existing functionality.

The original code tree under `src` was:

``` shell
├── src
|  ├── main
|  |  └── java
|  |     ├── Book.java
|  |     ├── Library.java
|  |     ├── Main.java
|  |     └── User.java
|  └── test
|     └── java
|        └── LibraryTest.java
```

After refactoring, the code tree is:

``` shell
├── lib
|  ├── application
|  |  └── use-cases
|  |     └── borrow-book-use-case.ts
|  ├── domain
|  |  ├── entities
|  |  |  ├── book.ts
|  |  |  ├── loan.ts
|  |  |  ├── specs
|  |  |  |  ├── book.test.ts
|  |  |  |  ├── loan.test.ts
|  |  |  |  └── user.test.ts
|  |  |  └── user.ts
|  |  └── interfaces
|  |     ├── book-repository.ts
|  |     └── user-repository.ts
|  ├── index.ts
|  ├── infrastructure
|  |  └── repositories
|  |     ├── in-memory-book-repository.ts
|  |     ├── in-memory-user-repository.ts
|  |     └── specs
|  |        ├── in-memory-book-repository.test.ts
|  |        └── in-memory-user-repository.test.ts
|  └── presentation
